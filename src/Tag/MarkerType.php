/**
 * The MarkerType defines the \StripState of the string data returned by a tag extension
 *
 * From documentaion in class Parser:
 *     [Tag]Hooks may return extended information by returning an array, of which the
 *     first numbered element (index 0) must be the return string, and all other
 *     entries are extracted into local variables within an internal function
 *     in the Parser class.
 *
 *     This interface (introduced r61913) appears to be undocumented, but
 *     'markerType' is used by some core tag hooks to override which strip
 *     array their results are placed in. **Use great caution if attempting
 *     this interface, as it is not documented and injudicious use could smash
 *     private variables.**
